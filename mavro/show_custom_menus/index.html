      Hey ___ this is ___ . Im just giving you a call about the request you sent
      us looking for more information about the IUL plans that help you build
      wealth Tax-Free.. It looks like your goal on here was ___ (what they have
      in notes).
      <br /><br />
      -My job is to help you figure out the different options available. Do you
      already have an IUL or is this your first time trying to figure it out?
      Okay, so what I will do is go through and explain the different options
      based on your goals and then ask a couple of underwriting questions to
      identify if this is something you can even get or that even makes sense
      for your situation… Does that make sense? Okay great
      <br /><br />
      -So there are a couple of different ways to structure these products.. One
      will have the highest death benefit that will last forever which is your
      protection focused. The goal for that is to have the most amount of
      insurance to last forever with the lowest premium per month.
      <br /><br />
      the second option is geared toward cash accumulation and retirement. The
      way it is structured is to have the minimum death benefit to max cash
      value. So what that really means is it will be setup on the lowest amount
      of life insurance (death benefit) required by the IRS so that way you max
      out the cash accumulation based on your monthly contribution. The cash
      value will grow 100% tax free which is KEY.
      <br /><br />
      But the downfall to all of this is that you can’t just go buy this off the
      shelf…. You DO have to get approved for it and what the carrier is looking
      at is your insurability because at the end of the day if you die or get
      sick tomorrow they are obligated to pay it out. Does that make sense?
      Explain the rest of it when you do the zoom. (Surface level so you don’t
      waste a ton of time if they can’t get approved and to build it up)
      <br /><br />
      The Carrier can see everything in your medical record from the last 10
      years including criminal and driving records to determine insurability. So
      do you have any medications that you’ve been prescribed in the last 10
      years even if you're not taking them anymore? IE: HB, Diabetic, Stroke,
      heart attack, EXT. Probation, Felonies, Parole, Suspended driver's
      licenses in the last 10 years? (write all of this down so you can check
      the underwriting guide)
      <br /><br />
      What do you do for work? Marital status? Annual income? On average 99% of
      people put around 5-10% of their monthly income into the policy. You know
      your budget better than I do, It has to fit in the budget or it doesn’t
      work at all….. I always prefer to be a little more conservative. What
      would make sense for you per month? Who will be the beneficiary on this in
      case you don’t spend all the money before you die?
      <br /><br />
      I am more of a visual person myself so I sent you a zoom link can you
      click on that for me so I can show you exactly how this will work for your
      situation. (STAY ON PHONE DURING ZOOM FOR AUDIO)
      <br /><br />
      Only book an appt if they don’t have time for the eapp and don't give any
      of the info out till the Zoom so that way you hold all the leverage.
      <br /><br />
      Key Points.
